It begins with the weathering of rocks, which are broken down into smaller particles by wind, rain, and temperature changes. Over time, organic matter from decaying plants and animals gets mixed in, creating a fertile topsoil that is essential for agriculture and supporting plant life. We must conserve this precious resource."

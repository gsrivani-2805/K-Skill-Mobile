It is usually written for friends, family, or people you know well. These messages are short, clear, and to the point. They do not need a lot of formal rules. The main idea is to share important information quickly and politely. Think of it like leaving a note for your mother or sending a quick text to a friend about school. Messages are often enclosed in a box, especially in written exams.",

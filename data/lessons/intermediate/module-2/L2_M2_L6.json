              "text": "Subject-verb agreement means that the subject and the verb in a sentence must match each other. If the subject is singular (one person, one animal, one thing), the verb must also be singular. If the subject is plural (more than one), the verb must also be plural. This is a very important rule in English grammar. Think of it like a pair of shoes: a left shoe and a right shoe must always go together. The subject is one shoe, and the verb is the other. They must match in number.",

              "text": "A very common mistake is using a singular verb (ending in 's' or 'es') with a plural subject, especially in the simple present tense. Remember: if the subject is plural (they, we, you, or any plural noun), the verb should not have an 's' or 'es' at the end. Also, remember that 'I' and 'You' are special. Even though they are singular, they always take a plural verb form in the simple present tense (I go, you go, not I goes, you goes).",
